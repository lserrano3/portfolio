    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hello, my name is Lourdes Serrano, and I am an Interaction Design major at Columbia College Chicago, with a concentration in Graphic Design and a minor in User Experience. Most of my work so far has been heavily centered in research and design
            </p>
    <p>I have had a love for graphic design ever since I took an introductory course in high school, but the thought of it becoming my career did not seem realistic for myself at the time. After graduating high school I went straight into community college to save money but also to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I debated between game design and computer science taking courses for each but ultimately I did not feel like it was my calling. After graduating with my associates degree, I took a break as I had no direction where I was heading. It was a very dark moment in my life where I felt like I did not belong anywhere and was not good at anything. It was not until I remembered my love for graphic design that I started looking into schools and saw the Interaction Design major at Columbia College Chicago. When I read the description, I had a sudden epiphany and knew right then, that was what I had been looking for.</p>
    
    <p>Every class and project I have had the pleasure of working on since starting this major has been such a blast. It is an incredible feeling to love the work you do and I am so fortunate for what I have been a part of throughout my college experience at Columbia College Chicago.</p>
