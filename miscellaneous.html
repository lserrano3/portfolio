    <p>Since the 70s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has conducted research into racial and ethnic discrimination in both rental and sales markets. They observed 28 metropolitan areas every decade by using a method of paired testing. This method compares how two people, of the same qualifications, are treated in the same tasks. The experiment compared how blacks, hispanics, and asians compare to equally qualified white participants in the following categories:
        
            </p><li>Making appointments</li>
            <li>In-person visits</li>
            <li>Inspect homes/apartments</li>
         <p></p>
    
       <p>The results from the most recent 2012 study found that in the process of renting, minority renters are told about and shown fewer homes and apartments than equally qualified whites. Results also did not suggest one region was more or less discriminatory than another which concludes this is a national issue.  </p>
