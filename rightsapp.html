    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project is divided in two parts, one in which I worked alongside a team to research the disconnect between renters and their rights and another where I worked alone to focus primarily on the impact of discrimination in the housing world for black and brown communities. Both with the ultimate goal of providing people with their renter’s rights in the form of an app.</p>

    <section class="problem">
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>In 2019, 43 million people, in the United States alone, rented housing units (Department & 5, 2020). With such a large portion of our population renting, and with that portion rising steadily every year since 1975, it seems only reasonable to assume that a platform to host resources on the rules and regulations of renting exists to provide information to the renters of America. This assumption would be wrong. While some internet resources exist, they are typically a small subsection on an individual city’s local government page. They are inconsistently manufactured across the U.S. and are often riddled with legal jargon, making finding a simple answer quickly a distant dream for the average renter. This begs the question, how are people renting in such vast quantities? Are people simply taking their chances not really understanding what renting implies? What are they responsible for? Does the average person have an adept understanding, through environmental learning alone, of their rights as renters? And how does all this affect marginalized communities specifically black and brown.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="solution">
<h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>A person’s ability to understand their rights will equip them with the knowledge to identify when their rights are being violated, what the landlord’s legal obligations are, and the tenant’s responsibilities. This can in turn eliminate the need for costly legal advice or difficult landlord-tenant relationships and protect their rights and privileges. In order for this to happen there needed to be a platform available to the public that would present their rights as renters in a filtered translated version that could be easily understood by anyone.</p>

    <h3>Knowing</h3>
    <p>The first portion of this app began with an extent amount of research into proving the problem was real. I did this by conducting competitive analysis, interviewing and surveying our target audience, and conducting a card sorting exercise in preparation for the UI. Gathering all of this data, I then created a low-fi figma prototype for the purpose of testing and refining. The final version of this app's name changed to 'Knowing'. </p>    
    </section>
<section class="roles2">
    <h3>Discrimination in Housing</h3>
    <p>The second portion of this app followed the development and research of our initial steps but with a heavier emphasis on the discrimination in black and brown communites. My goal for this was to shed light on the issue and make the connection between discrimination based on where you live and the color of your skin. To accomplish this I focused on extensive research into the beginning of housing discrimination, the attempts made to fix the issue, and what it looks like now. I also conducted interviews of people who have experienced discrimination in housing. All of this put into a database site for easy access.  </p>
